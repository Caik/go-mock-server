## üíø Installation

### 1. Docker

The easiest and recommended way to run **Go Mock Server** is via **Docker**: 

```bash
docker run --name mock-server --rm -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/sample-mocks:/mocks caik/go-mock-server:latest --mocks-directory /mocks
```

Where `$(pwd)/sample-mocks` is the path in your host machine where you have stored the mocks files. In case you want to start the application without any pre-existing mock files, you can also omit it:

```bash
docker run --name mock-server --rm -p 8080:8080 caik/go-mock-server:latest --mocks-directory /mocks
```

Please also note that you change the port mapping from `8080` to any other port of your preference. 

### 2. Pre-compiled Binaries

Alternatively, you can download and run the already pre-compiled binaries. There are versions for **Linux**, **Mac**, and **Windows** on the **[Releases](https://github.com/Caik/go-mock-server/releases)** page.
So you only have to choose the appropriate file, download, extract it and run the binary in your machine.

PS: You may need to give execution permission to the binary after downloading it:

 ```shell
# giving execution permission on linux
chmod +x ./mock-server
```

### 3. Compiling Your Own Binary

If you have **Go** configured on your environment, you can also choose to build your own binary as well:

```shell
# building a MacOS on AMD64 binary
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -a -ldflags '-extldflags "-static" -s -w' -o ./mock-server-darwin-amd64 cmd/mock-server/main.go
```

<br />

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Running the App

Please check [Installation](#-installation) for how to get/build the application binary. 

After you have the binary, you can run the server: 

```bash
# Example for Mac
./mock-server_mac --mocks-directory ./path-for-the-mocks-directory
```

### 2. Creating Mocks

To mock HTTP responses, you have two options:

#### a) Writing Mock Files:

Create mock files by writing the desired response body in a file within the specified mocks directory. Follow the naming convention for systematic organization: `{path-to-mocks-directory}/{host}/{uri-and-querystring}.{http-method}`

For example: `./path-for-the-mocks-directory/example.com/api/v1/resource.get`

Here's a breakdown of the components in the file name:

- `{path-to-mocks-directory}`: The directory where mock files are stored.
- `{host}`: The host name for which the mock is intended.
- `{uri-and-querystring}`: The URI and optional query string of the API endpoint.
- `{http-method}`: The HTTP method for which the mock is intended.

This convention allows for easy identification and management of specific mocks.

```bash
# Example for creating a mock file:
# GET example.com/api/v1/resource
echo '{"key": "value"}' > ./path-for-the-mocks-directory/example.com/api/v1/resource.get
```

#### b) Dynamic Mock Creation via API:

Alternatively, you can use the dedicated API to dynamically create mocks during runtime:

```bash
# Example for creating a mock via API:
# GET example.com/api/v1/resource
curl -X POST \
  -H "x-mock-host: example.host.com" \
  -H "x-mock-uri: /api/v1/resource" \
  -H "x-mock-method: GET" \
  --data-raw '{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }' \
  http://localhost:8080/admin/mocks

```

To delete a mock:

```bash
# Example for deleting a mock via API:
# GET example.com/api/v1/resource
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "x-mock-host: example.host.com" \
  -H "x-mock-uri: /api/v1/resource" \
  -H "x-mock-method: GET" \
  http://localhost:8080/admin/mocks
```

For more details and additional API endpoints, please refer to the [Swagger documentation](https://github.com/Caik/go-mock-server/blob/main/docs/swagger.json).

### 3. Simulate Errors and Latencies

To enhance your testing experience, Go Mock Server provides powerful API endpoints for dynamically simulating errors and adjusting latencies. These features are particularly useful for testing your application's resilience under different conditions.

#### Simulate Errors
To simulate errors for a specific host, you can use the following example:

```bash
# Simulate a 500 Error for 20% of the requests to the host example.host.com
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "host": "example.host.com",
  "errors": {
    "500": {
      "percentage": 20
    }
  }
}' http://localhost:8080/admin/config/hosts/example.host.com/errors
```

#### Simulate Latency

```bash
# Simulating latency for the host example.host.com
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "host": "example.host.com",
  "latency": {
    "min": 100,
    "p95": 1800,
    "p99": 1900,
    "max": 2000
  }
}' http://localhost:8080/admin/config/hosts/example.host.com/latencies
```

For more details and additional API endpoints, please refer to the [Swagger documentation](https://github.com/Caik/go-mock-server/blob/main/docs/swagger.json).

### 4. Integrate with Your Application

Integrating Go Mock Server with your application is a straightforward process. By updating your application's URLs to point to Go Mock Server, you enable seamless testing and development. Go Mock Server intelligently identifies and sets the correct request host based on URI and HTTP method.

#### Example Scenario:

Let's consider a scenario where you have a web application that communicates with an external API. Initially, your application is configured to interact with the production API as follows:

```plaintext
Production API Base URL: https://example.host.com
```

Now, you want to test your application with different mock responses provided by Go Mock Server. Here's how you can integrate Go Mock Server into your testing environment:

##### 1. Update Application Configuration:

Update your application's configuration to point to the Go Mock Server URL:

```plaintext
Go Mock Server URL: http://localhost:8080
```

##### 2. Make Requests:

Your application can now make requests to Go Mock Server, and Go Mock Server will dynamically provide the mock responses based on the configured mocks.

For example, if your application originally made a request to:

```plaintext
GET https://example.host.com/data
```

Now the request will be:

```plaintext
GET http://localhost:8080/data
```

Go Mock Server will handle the request and respond according to the configured mocks.


### 5. Explore the Command-Line Options

To customize Go Mock Server's behavior, you can use the following command-line options:

| Option                  | Description                                                |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| --mocks-directory       | Specify the directory for mock files.                      |
| --port                  | Set the port for the mock server. Default is 8080.         |
| --mocks-config-file     | Specify the path to a config file for additional settings. |
| --disable-cache         | Disable caching of responses.                              |
| --disable-latency       | Disable simulation of latency in responses.                |
| --disable-error         | Disable simulation of error responses.                     |

**Example:**

```bash
# Run the server on port 9090 with a custom mock directory and disable cache
./mock-server_mac --mocks-directory ./custom-mocks --port 9090 --disable-cache
```
